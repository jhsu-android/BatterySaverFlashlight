Welcome to the Battery Saver Flashlight!

There are many Android flashlight apps.  What makes this Android app unique is that it provides the user the option
of turning off WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, and/or cellular services in order to conserve battery power.

Please note that the Wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth functionality do NOT work with the AVD.

Changes to make:
Make the automatic updates of the WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS status work properly.  (Using ScheduledExecutorService to do
this destabilized the app and caused it to quit unexpectedly.)  Apparently, there was a memory leak.
